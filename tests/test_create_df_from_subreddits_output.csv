kid,generic,True,116,Aposematicpebble,I think she meant the part where he soiled himself. She thinks that must have been genuinely an accident since that kid was embarrassed,1653708841,ia9wgki,entitledparents
mother,mixed,True,140,SekritSawce,Are you considered an adult in the country in which you live?  Is there something cultural that may explain how seemingly unreasonable your mother is being?  And how does her having to work the next day factor in?,1653708569,ia9vyri,entitledparents

parent,mixed,False,821,JCWa50,"This is going to be hard.  In life the universe hands you lessons.  you either take the first time, as it is easy, or you end up getting hit hard with the second lesson.

And there is a lesson here, and that is that sometimes you have to know when to step up and other times when you have to stand back and let things fall as they may.

However, you also have something viable that you can use.  The threat of telling.  In short you may want to walk your RM through the place and tell her what is and is not acceptable such as the kitchen not being clean, or the smell or the flies and ect.  And she will end up going ok, until you get to the place to sit down and you look at her and state this:  If you do not change, and I expect to see such say by tomorrow, I guess I will have no option but to call and talk to your parents, including telling your mother where you are lving and giving her the address.  Shall I type it in now, or would you like to try again, and say take care of these issues?

If she does not, maybe calling or contacting the mother and letting her know that you are moving out and the address of where her daughter lives, may not be such a bad idea.",1653708283,ia9vfon,entitledparents
