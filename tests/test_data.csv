dad,"mixed",TRUE,97,GenderConfusedKid,"hi man, just wanna preface this with I'm MtF freshly 18. I'm genuinely really sorry to hear your dad isn't supportive, as a girl with a father who isn't supportive it really hurts to hear. I hope he comes around to it as the years go on and he see's you becoming happier.  Mind if i ask how long you've realised you're trans for and how much you've socially transitioned?",1647047379,i0bcl06,transgenderteens

dad,"generic",TRUE,19,creamy_kidneys,I'd say speak with dad about it. As someone who's been the child in this situation the best you can do is make your home the most supportive enviroment you can. And make sure you listen to him. If you're already doing those things that's good. It may take some time but I think he'll start to apreciate it. If you're not doing those things than I would suggest you start.,1642304951,hsuwl6v,transgenderteens

child,"generic",TRUE,52,BOGGspotter,"Hey! I feel you. I was in this situation but as the child. My mom then tried to get me professional help from a psychologist, I even spent some time in a psychiatric clinic to get some distance from my dad. Especially because your son seems to self-harm, that's an important measure in my opinion (but only do it with his consent of course). What might also help is listening to him. Check in on him regularly, ask how he feels, if you can do anything for him. Show him that you care for him and that you worry about him. Spend time with him. Maybe, if he wants that, you can organise a safe space for him that he can always go to, like a good friend's home or similar, and maybe think of an alibi why he's not at home.",1642233941,hsqpp2q,transgenderteens
