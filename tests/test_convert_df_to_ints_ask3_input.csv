girlfriend,specific,True,28,UltimateStrenergy,The reactions and sounds my girlfriend makes. It feels really satisfying giving her powerful orgasms like that.,1653610955,ia4twym,AskMen
father,mixed,True,38,Psychological_Pea681,Do not project your anger towards his father to him. My mother did that and my dad and I had a shoddy relationship until I had my little girl and he stepped up to be a grandfather. I hated my dad growing up but now seeing how my mother is I know that the world is not always black and white. My father happily married again and my mother stayed single. My father is successful but my mother is not. Every kid deserves to have both parents wether in the same household or not.,1653610890,ia4ts8a,AskMen

kid,generic,False,395,YazmindaHenn,"Yeah I know we have the specialist firearms unit for these special circumstances, but I couldn't imagine every police officer just having a gun on them. That would be outrageous.

Yeah the US attitude towards guns is really batshit crazy. They need to fix that or mass kurdrrs will keep happening, and all the top comments are completely ignoring the fact that the guns are the issue. Cuddling kids etc, what? No, guns are the problem",1653493243,i9y429i,AskReddit
child,generic,False,140,SortaKindaYeah,"In my opinion we, as a culture, need to address childhood mental health at a public level. There needs to be a focus on resources for young children and adolescents who are born and raised in poor environments (and I'm not talking wealth). We need to create an environment where kids feel safe to discuss and express their emotions that's accessible to everyone in public schools.

Yes I'm aware schools have counseling staff but in my opinion (from what school counselor friend tells me) is that it's very weak and not as funded as it should be. As someone who is all for the right to arm I don't think the ability to own a firearm is the common denominator in these types of situations.",1653493242,i9y427c,AskReddit
sister,generic,False,390,Ok_Sheepherder_8313,"I feel the same, except ""American Mary"" is quite fun. But that's mainly just about a med student who drops out after be r*ped by her professor, and coincidentally had accidentally bumped into body modification soon before.

It's all consensual (except the r*pe revenge bit, but it's not really shown), people pay her for said body modification. The most extreme (aside from r*pist) is twin sisters (the directors, actually) who want to swap arms so they'll be with each other ""forever"" if something happens. And the only thing that grossed me out, was the big global of snot that ended up dangling from the professor's nose, while he was crying.",1653701569,ia9irs5,AskWomen
